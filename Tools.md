# General Tools


## Drills
 A drill is a power tool with two different directions that worked by spinning a drill bit either right or left. A drill is used to drill holes through specific materials. Contrary to commmon belief, spinning the drill faster doesn't always decrease the time taken to drill through the material. For example, when drilling through stronger materials like metal, add more force on the drill in the direction you are drilling while, holding the drill straight. However, when drilling through softer and more delicate materials like plastic and ABS, spin the drill faster. 
## Wrench
The wrench is a two sided tool that is used to tighten or loosen bolts. Each wrench has a specific size and corresponds to the a bolt's size. The most common size is the 3/8 wrench. The wrenches work by spinning one side of the bolt in one direction while holding the other side in place. Similar concepts apply where spinning right tightens the bolt while, spinning left loosens the bolt. For faster removal or installation rotate both sides of the bolt in opposite directions.
## Ratchet
The ratchet is like a wrench, but only allows the bolt to move in one direction. This eliminates the need to rotate the tool in a full circle allowing bolts to be manipulated in small spaces. To change the direction simply push the small metal bar toward the corresponding direction. Ratchets like wrenches have different sizes.
## Allen Key
The allen key is a hex tool that is used to turn allen head bolts. Allen keys are normally used to hold one side of the bolt while, a wrench holds the bolt's nut. Allen keys also come in many different sizes. In Skyline robotics the green T handle is the most common allen key.
## Vise Grip
The vise grip is more or less a handheld clamp. The vise grip can be used as a substitute for holding one side of a bolt or to pry/pull on objects. 
## Saw
The saw is a handheld tool used to cut material. It's pretty straightforward. 
## Rivet guns
Work in progress.
