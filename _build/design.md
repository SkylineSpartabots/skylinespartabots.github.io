# Design
## Step 1: Figure out what your problem is
For step 1, it is important to recognize the challenge you are facing and what you want to accomplish with the mechanism you are designing. After understand the task you want to create, move on to step 2.
## Step 2: Spend time figuring out what you constraints are
Step 2 is composed of looking at the constraints you are under. Here you make sure your mechanism is fully legal, according to the rules. You also need to plan for issues such as space, time, materials, motors, and anything else the team decides as a whole. 
## Step 3: Creating a Prototype
For step three you need to fully come up with a design after considering the first two steps. This is where the Spartabot thinks creatively to solve the problem. The first part of this step is to draft up an idea on a white board. After drawing, and visualizing the design, trasnsition to making a model that is to scale. With this model, you can better understand the mechanism in three dimensional space. Once the model looks good, you can make a wood model. Once you get the wood model down test your model thoroughly by identifying constraints and reliability. At this point you can continue to make changes until you are at a product that works as planned. At this point you build the final mechanism out of metal and the materials that were initially set asides for the project. After this point you can tweak and make it better, but in general if you follow this design process you will end up with a very efficient and effective mechanism.  This is alsp extremely important as it creates designs that have backing behind them and are well throughout. This helps the team end up with better designs and save time during the designing processes.
