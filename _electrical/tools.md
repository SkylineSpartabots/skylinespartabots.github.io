## Wire strippers

Wire strippers are used to remove the outer coating (usually plastic) of a wire to expose the copper ends. Stripping a wire is required to put the wire into a receptacle, such as a PDP board.

1. Match the gauge of the wire to the appropriate hole on the wire stripper.
2. Place the wire in the hole and close tightly. If you want to strip an inch, then place the wire an inch out.
3. Use some force to pull the wire stripper towards the cut end of the wire.
4. Throw away the casing.

## Crimpers

Crimping is used to connect two pieces of metal (a wire and a connecter) by deforming the connector around the wire.
